# TSP Genetic Algorithm + Simulated Annealing

This project implements a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP),
with support for:

- PMX crossover
- Edge Recombination (ERX)
- Segment-shuffle mutation
- Tournament and roulette selection
- Simulated Annealing hybrid local search
- Elitism and convergence tracking
